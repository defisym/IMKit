# How to get SDL binaries

SDL2 and SDL_Mixer_X are used here.

You can build them according to the instructions in the SDL2 and SDL_mixer_X repositories, or download from the release.

Put header files in `include`, and dll & lib in `lib/x64` or `lib/x86` repectively. Both libs can be merged without conlict.
